## Research interests

As a computational condensed matter physicist, I focus my research activity in the description of how quantum anharmonicity 
affects the thermodynamic properties of materials.

We developed a [method](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1361-648X/ac066b) ([SSCHA](https://sscha.eu/)) to simulate thermodynamic and phononic properties of materials accounting for anharmonicity at a nonperturbative level, fully including quantum and thermal fluctuations.

I focused on the description of the phase diagram of ice in the high-pressure region. In these extreme conditions, ice is stable in the VII, VIII and X phases.

I investigated the structural and thermodynamic properties of high-pressure ice using this method, showing how quantum effects change completely the
classical phase diagram.
