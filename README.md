## Research interests

As a computational condensed matter physicist, I focus my research activity in the description of how quantum anharmonicity 
affects the thermodynamic properties of materials.

We developed a [method](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1361-648X/ac066b) ([SSCHA](https://sscha.eu/)) to simulate thermodynamic and phononic properties of materials accounting for anharmonicity at a nonperturbative level, fully including quantum and thermal fluctuations.

I focused on the description of the phase diagram of ice in the high-pressure region. In these extreme conditions, ice is stable in the VII, VIII and X phases.

I investigated the structural and thermodynamic properties of those structures within the SSCHA framework, showing how quantum effects overturn completely the classical phase diagram. [Our results](https://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.110.014112) show how phase X appears at about 50 GPa, independently of the temperatures, in agreement with the experimental data.
