## Research interests

As a computational condensed matter physicist, I focus my research activity in the description of how quantum anharmonicity 
affects the thermodynamic properties of materials.

We developed a [method](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1361-648X/ac066b) ( [SSCHA] (https://sscha.eu/)) to simulate thermodynamic and phononic properties of materials accounting for anharmonicity at a nonperturbative level, fully including quantum and thermal fluctuations.
